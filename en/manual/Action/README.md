# Action System

The chapter introduces the Action System of QICI Engine. The Action System contains two tools: [Action Editor](ActionEditor.md) and [Action Manager](ActionManager.md).  
[Action Editor](ActionEditor.md) is used to edit _Action Clip_ file.  
[Action Manager](ActionManager.md) is used to combine many _Action Clip_ and _Action Manager Clip_ files, and outputs _Action Manager Clip_ file.
