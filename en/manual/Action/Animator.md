# Animator Component 
If game object need to play _Action Clip_ or _Action Manager Clip_ file, it must mount an [Animator Component](Animator.md). Like the following:

In above picture, Animators can have many _Action Clip_ or _Action Manager Clip_ files. It means that a game object can play many _Action Clip_ or _Action Manager Clip_.  
The _Action Clip_ file is generated by [Action Editor](ActionEditor.md). The _Action Manager Clip_ file is generated by [Action Manager](ActionManager.md).
