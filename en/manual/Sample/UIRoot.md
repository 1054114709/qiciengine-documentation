# UIRoot
The UIRoot object is mostly used as the root node of all UI objects, with a ScaleAdapter script added internally. The UIRoot object's size and scale will be adjusted by the ScaleAdapter script automatically, according to the configuration of the ScaleAdapter script. You don't need to change any properties about Transform. See [Screen Adaptation](../UI/AdapterResolution.md).
