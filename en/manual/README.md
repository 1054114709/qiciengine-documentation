QICI Core can be used to make a HTML5 Game by writing code without QICI Editor. But for complex UI, it’s really hard to build and maintain without the help of what-you-see-is-what-you-get visual interface, with QICI Editor even artists and designers can help to build the game’s UI. QICI Widget is used internally to provide all HTML5 UI widgets that is needed to build QICI Editor interface.

QICI Core is a JavaScript Game library, QICI Widget is a JavaScript UI library, QICI Editor using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for File I/O operations, so QICI Engine is a Full-Stack JavaScript Game Engine.
